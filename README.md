# COVID-19 Tableau Visualization

I have created a dashboard with four visualizations to analyze and understand effects of Covid-19 Globaly.

### [Visualization Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid-19Dashboard_17201999956250/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)


The primary goals of my visualizations are:

- How each country has been effected by Corona virus? 
- Total Cases and deaths and the Death Percentage?
- How each continent was affected by Covid-19?
- How the top countries were affected by covid-19 (top 7)?
