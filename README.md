# COVID-19 Tableau Visualization 

I have created a dashboard with four visualizations to analyze and understand effects of Covid-19 Globaly.

### [Covid-19 Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid-19Dashboard_17201999956250/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)


The primary goals of my visualizations are:

- Total Cases, Total Deaths and the Death Percentage Worldwide?
- How each Continent was affected by Covid-19?
- How each Country has been effected by Covid-19? 
- How the Top Countries were affected by covid-19 (Top 7)?
- How many Countries have less than 50% Vaccination By 2024?
- How many Countries have been Fully Vaccinated By 2024?
- Vaccinations Administered till May 1, 2024 in India?

**Visualization 1**: *Covid-19 Global Numbers*
A Simple Tabular view representing Total Cases, Total deaths and Death Percentage Globally.

**Visualization 2**: *Total Deaths per Continent*
A horizontal bar graph representing the six continents affected by covid-19, with Europe being the continent with highest number of deaths which counts up to 2,100,105 deaths followed by North America, Asia, South America, Africa, with Oceania being the continent with least numbers of deaths which counts up to 33,153 deaths.

**Visualization 3**: *Infection Rate Per Country*
A World Map that displays the covid-19 infection rate across various countries, the map uses a color gradient to represent the infection rate with the legend on the top right corner indicating the range from 0.00 to 77.10 percent.

Key Observations:
- High Infection Rates: Western Europe stands out with some of the highest infection rates.
- Moderate Infection Rates: Observed in parts of North and South America, as well as Australia.
- Lower Infection Rates: Predominant in many African and Southeast Asian countries.

This map provides a visual representation of the spread and severity of COVID-19 across the globe. The darker red areas highlight regions with significant infection rates, potentially indicating higher transmission rates or larger outbreaks. Lighter colors indicate regions with lower infection rates, which could be due to effective control measures, lower transmission rates, or other factors.

**Visualization 4**: *Top Seven Globally InfectedÂ Countries*
A line graph representing the top 7 most affected countries by covid-19, the x-axis represents the timeline from 2020 to 2024, while the y-axis shows the infection rate.

Overall Observation:
- Steep Increases: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom exhibit rapid early increases, which later stabilize.
- Gradual Increases: The United States and Russia show more consistent and gradual increases.
- Low Increases: China maintains a low infection rate with slight growth.
- Decline: India shows an unusual decline to zero by 2024.

**Visualization 5**: *Countries With less than 50% Vaccination By 2024?*
This World Map provides a global overview of vaccination rates, highlighting countries expected to fall below the 50% threshold. It uses a color gradient from green to red, where green represents areas with the highest coverage near the 50% mark and red denotes those with the lowest. The legend, positioned on the upper right, spans from 0.00% to 49.26%, offering a clear understanding of the color-coded data. 

Key Observations:

**Visualization 6**: *Covid-19 Full Vaccination Coverage Worldwide By 2024?*

**Visualization 7**: *Vaccinations Administered till May 1, 2024 - India*

**Conclusion**

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted countries around the globe, with varying infection rates and trends. This project has analyzed and visualized COVID-19 data to better understand the spread and severity of the virus across different regions.
